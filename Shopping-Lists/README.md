# About #
The purpose of this app was to develop 3 RESTful routes. All three of my routes (users, shopping lists, and items) have full CRUD functionality. Most of my time was spent towards the routes' functionality. As for my styling, I did not use any frameworks and tried have my theme spread across multiple pages to save code and time.

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have liked to add a 'Recipe of the Day' where the user could click 'copy ingredients to shopping list'. I also would have liked to add categories to each item to further help sort the shopping list items.
